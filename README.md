# Feature_engineering_for_titanic_dataset
Create the feature engineering component of a Machine Learning pipeline for titanic dataset. This should prepare data for processing.

# Business Problem
The data preprocessing and variable engineering script required for a machine learning pipeline needs to be prepared. It is expected that the data set will be ready for modeling when it is passed through this script.
